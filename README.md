### Project and exercises for **Mathematical Modelling** course, UL FMF 2021/22
- *Lecturer:* dr. Emil Žagar
- *Assistant:* dr. Tadej Kanduč

*Some helper functions or function outlines/function docstrings (to use as a starting point) were provided to us along with the instructions by the staff*

My solutions for [exercise problems](exercises), [quizzes](quizzes) and the [exam](exam) in MATLAB.

## Final Project: *Modelling of modified Buffon's needle problem*

Similarly to [Buffon's needle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem), I was modelling the toss of a coin with radius r and an equilateral triangle with side a. I wrote a program that models the toss of a coin and a triangle, and compared the numerical calculation of the probability with the analytical calculation.
